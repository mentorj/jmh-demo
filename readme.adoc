# JMH Demo
:author:Jerome Moliere - deadbrain - jerome@javaxpert.com

## Introduction
This repository shows basic usage for JMH microbenchmarking harness suite

## Comments & pitfalls

### pom.xml

In your projects do not forget to add JMH annotation processor dependency!!

### Code

#### configuration
Most configuration  done through annotations on benchmark methods (should be public as ruled by the framework)
One noticeable exception is the number of loops defined with a counter but annotated in the code with @Param to  be set to 3 different values

#### Black holes

JVM makes a lot of optimization and especially regarding dead code ...If you simply invokes some code and don't use it this code
cam be considered as dead code and never invoked ...That 's why JMH provides BlackHoles class to consume code eventually dropped at runtime.
It is used in these benchmarking methods.

### Benchmarks

This demo does not show all kind of benchmarks offered by JMH,  feel free to adapt this code and change some settings.
